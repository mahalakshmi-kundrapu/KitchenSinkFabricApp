(ii) The servers hosting Online Banking at Digital Insight have been certified by \"Certificate Authority\" to assure you that you are actually talking to Digital Insight instead of someone pretending to be Digital Insight. Depending on the age of your browser, you may see that \"Certificate Authorities\" have expired. If this happens, you must update it on your browser. Instructions for upgrading your browser are located in the Browser Update Link, which is located at the bottom of the Online Banking login page. (iii) Digital Insight will pass an encrypted cookie to your computer during your Online Banking sessions. These cookies do not collect any personal information about you.

The cookie is destroyed when you log off of Online Banking, close your browser, or turn off your computer.</li><li><strong> Security Notices: </strong> In addition to the security features described above, there may be other security-related notices posted on our web site or Online Banking service from time to time.

Online Banking balances may also differ from your records due to deposits in progress, checks outstanding, or other circumstances. When a transaction is presented to us via Online Banking, we will use the available balance in your account to determine whether to authorize the transaction. Our completion of a transaction does not necessarily mean that there are sufficient funds to pay all items that have not cleared your account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> 10. Fees </strong></p><p>Online Banking is free. The same fees that apply to account transactions conducted by other means will apply to transactions initiated using Online Banking or Bill Payer.

Our Liability for Failure to Cancel or Stop Payments </strong></p><p>If you attempt to cancel a payment or transfer and we do not do so even though we have sufficient time to act on your request, we will be liable for your losses or damages.

If you do not tell us within 60 days after we sent you the first statement on which the unauthorized transfer or payment appeared, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60-day period if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us on time.</li><li>If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital stay) prevented you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.</li><li>Remember that if you give someone your Access ID and Passcode, you are authorizing them to use Online Banking, Bill Payer and External transfer Wire service and you are responsible for all transactions they perform until you tell us to change or cancel your Access ID and Passcode.
